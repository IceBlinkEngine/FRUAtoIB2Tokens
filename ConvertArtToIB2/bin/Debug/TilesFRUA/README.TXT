This is the complete set of templates for use with WALLEDIT. These are the
exact same unmodified images you can get using WALLSEE (the newly released
version, not the one that came with WALLEDIT).

These images still have the original walls on them, making them ideal for
making minor adjustments--or to help get the perspectives and lining up
straight.

applause, while you're at it.
