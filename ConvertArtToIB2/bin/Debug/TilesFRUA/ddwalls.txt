            Dungeons & Dragons: Warriors of the Eternal Sun Walls
                     by Mike Ring (Ringo062@aol.com)

On the suggestion of one of the FRUA mailing list members, I downloaded
a Genesis emulator and Warriors of the Eternal Sun to see if I could get
any wallsets and backdrops for use in UA. These are my first 3 sets.

These walls weren't that easy to convert- the walls of Warriors of the
Eternal Sun are something like 128x56 (UA's are 56x56). I brought the color
up to 16 million, resampled, then reduced to the number of slots available
for walls. This worked out well, as the resampling made the walls look even
better than the game versions, in most cases.

DD1:    These walls and backdrop are from the castle guard towers.
        Anyone know what the thing in W_dd1-4 is? I don't.
        The walls go in ROCK A.
DD2:    These walls and backdrop are from a cave south of the castle.
        I think W_dd2-4 is supposed to be a pool of water.
        The walls go in ADOBE.
DD3:    These walls and backdrop are from several caves.
        The backdrop doesn't look that good... sorry.
        The walls go in ROCK B.
DD4:    The green caves are located deep in the Burrower's lair.
        The walls go in ADOBE.

There are 2 wall sets from Warriors of the Eternal that I have not yet
converted, the Azcan and Drow Temples (really the same wallset, only
recolored).
