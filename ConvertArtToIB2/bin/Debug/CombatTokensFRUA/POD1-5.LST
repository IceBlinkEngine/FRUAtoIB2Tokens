PCXICONS: POD Combat Icons 1-5
Originally uploaded:  July 16, 1993

  This archive contains 40 PCX icons from SSI's Pools of Darkness.  
An immense amount of work went into capturing and converting it for 
use in Unlimited Adventures, and for this, full credit should go to 
Viking1@aol.com.  :]
  This is a slightly altered version of the former POD1-5 archive.  
Notably, the original was 281,587 bytes;  this archive takes up much 
less space (over 75% less) while still containing the same artwork.  
The overall file size was reduced by "blacking out" the unneeded text 
and pictures that were left over from the original "drawcpic" template.
  The size of each "page" has been reduced for these as well, but this 
has no effect on their usefulness in UA.  ;>
  Again, credit for this upload should go to Viking1 for the incredible 
effort needed to bring these icons to the UA community.  :]

available on AOL).  I hope you find these icons useful for your 
creations.  Have fun!
  To use, consult your UA manual.
